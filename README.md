jsboot.js
=============

About
-------------

There is only jsBoot

The onegateisopening folder consists of basic wrapping, including Spitfire (shim enforcer), and the *basic* elements to build a working
pipe between a html nutshell, the service its hosted on, and a parent frame equipped to handle postMessages communication.
It should have zero dependency, and is supposed to run on many browsers.

The mingus folder consists of variously involved, *generic* "extensions" to javascript, that are not of jsboot (typically, uri grammar,
digest-auth enabled xmlhttprequest, etc).
Mingus should have only one dependency: an ES5-ready browser - by hook or by shims.

The jsboot folder is the framework itself, including various high-level generic classes (package manager, etc).
JsBoot depends on a fully patched browser, and on Mingus.
